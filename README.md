## Project Description
This project provides tools and software for planning and managing orienteering courses, specifically designed for sprint events. Utilizing graph theory and a greedy algorithm, specifically Dijkstra's algorithm, the software efficiently finds the optimum paths for course layouts on imported maps. This approach allows for optimal route planning and visualization, making it invaluable for event planners and participants alike.

## Features
- **Graph-Based Data Handling**: Implements graph theory to manage the complexities of orienteering courses.
- **Map Importing**: Easily import digital map files.
- **Course Design**: Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm to design courses that offer the most efficient path for competitors.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of courses overlaid on digital maps for easy adjustment and planning.
- **Greedy Algorithm Optimization**: Ensures that the course design is not only practical but optimized for competitive orienteering.

## Installation
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Download the `graph.jar` file from the releases page.
3. Run the following command to start the application: java -jar path/to/graph.jar

## Usage
To use the course planner:
1. Launch the application using the command provided above.
2. Import your map using the `WSOC15-sprint.map` file.
3. Load the course data from the `WSOC15-sprint.course` file.
4. Use the GUI to modify or check the course layout, ensuring optimal paths are chosen according to the algorithm.
